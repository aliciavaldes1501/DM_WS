# Preparations

To make the workshop run smoothly, you need to have a couple of programs installed on your own computer. I'm assuming that you have a Windows computer.

## R and RStudio
If you haven't got R and RStudio installed already, download and install from:
* R: https://cran.rstudio.com/
* RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/

## git and SourceTree
### git
* Follow instructions at http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#windows (*Option 1*)
    * ‘mysysgit’ or 'Git Bash'
    * https://git-for-windows.github.io/
        * Download and Run
            * Use git from the windows command prompt
            * Checkout Win style, Commit Unix style
            * Use MinTTY
            * Enable file system caching
* SourceTree
    * https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
        * Download and Run
            * Install .Net Framework pre-req if suggested
        * First run
            * register atlassian account or use existing one
            * Skip - connect account - check how to do it later
            * Install tools - defaults
            * Install global .ignore file - Yes
            * Load SSH key? Cancel - get a key
