# Preparations

To make the workshop run smoothly, you need to have a couple of programs installed on your own computer. I'm assuming that you have a Windows computer.

## R and RStudio
If you haven't got R and RStudio installed already, download and install from:

* **R**: [https://cran.rstudio.com/]()
* **RStudio**: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/]()

## git and SourceTree

### git
* Follow instructions at http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#windows (**Option 1**)
  * Install _Git for Windows_ (previously known as ‘mysysgit’ or 'Git Bash'):
    * [https://git-for-windows.github.io/]()
    * Download and Run installer
      * Choose the default settings when stepping through the installer
        * Default selection of Components
        * "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
        * "Checkout Win style, Commit Unix style"
        * "Use MinTTY"
        * "Enable file system caching"
        * Click install

### SourceTree
* Go to [https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/]()
  * Click the _Download for Windows_ button, and Run installer
    * _**Note!** When testing on 7 Nov, the downloaded installer file did not have an **.exe** file ending. If you also encounter this problem, rename the downloaded file so that it ends with **.exe** and double-click._
	* Choose the default location
	* Install .Net Framework pre-req if suggested
  * Select _Launch SourceTree_, and click the _Finish_ button
	  * Check the box for license agreement
    * Click _Go to My Atlassian_ to register an Atlassian account - then log in
    * Skip _Connect an account_
    * _Mercurial not found_ - select _Download an embedded version..._
    * You might be asked some more questions
      * "Install tools" - select defaults
      * "Install global .ignore file" - Yes
      * "Load SSH key?" - Cancel
