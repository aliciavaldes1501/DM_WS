# The problem

## ...

## just put them here

## Suggested best-practices
- There is a **folder for the raw data**, which do not get altered, or intermixed with data that is the result of manual or programmatic manipulation. I.e., derived data is kept separate from raw data, and **raw data is not duplicated**.
- **Code is kept separate from data**.
- There is a **scratch directory for experimentation**. Everything in the scratch directory can be deleted at any time without negative impact.
- There should be a **README in every directory**, describing the purpose of the directory and its contents.
- **Manuscript production** output is kept separate from everything else.
- Use **non-proprietary formats** – .csv rather than .xlsx
- Etc…

## Non-proprietary formats
- A **text-based** format is more future-safe, than a proprietary binary format by a commercial vendor
- Never, never, never use Excel for _science_!
- **Markdown** is a nice way of getting nice output from text.
    - Simple & readable formating
    - Can be converted to lots of different outputs
        - HTML, pdf, MS Word, slides etc
