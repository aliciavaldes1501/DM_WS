## What is version control?
- A system that keeps records of your changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made what changes and when
- **Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state**

## What is version control?
- Distributed version control
- Users keep entire code and history on their location machines
	- Users can make any changes without internet access
	- (Except pushing and pulling changes from a remote server)

## What is git?
- Started in 2005
- Created by Linus Torvald to aid in Linux kernel development

## Other version control systems
- Subversion (SVN)
- Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
- Perforce
- Mercurial
- Bazaar

## How does git work?
- Can be complicated at first, but there are a few key concepts
- Important git terminology in following slides are blue

## Key Concepts: Snapshots
- The way git keeps track of your code history
- Essentially records what all your files look like at a given point in time
- You decide when to take a snapshot, and of what files
- Have the ability to go back to visit any snapshot
	- Your snapshots from later on will stay around, too

## Key Concepts: Commit
- The act of creating a snapshot
- Can be a noun or verb
	- “I commited code”
	- “I just made a new commit”
- Essentially, a project is made up of a bunch of commits

## Key Concepts: Commit
- Commits contain three pieces of information:

1. Information about how the files changed from previously
2. A reference to the commit that came before it
	- Called the “parent commit”
3. A hash code name
	- Will look something like:
		f2d2ec5069fc6776c80b3ad6b7cbde3cade4e

## Key Concepts: Repositories
- Often shortened to ‘repo’
- A collection of all the files and the history of those files
	- Consists of all your commits
	- Place where all your hard work is stored

## Key Concepts: Repositories
- Can live on a local machine or on a remote server (GitHub!)
- The act of copying a repository from a remote server is called cloning
- Cloning from a remote server allows teams to work together

## Key Concepts: Repositories
- The process of downloading commits that don’t exist on your machine from a remote repository is called pulling changes
- The process of adding your local changes to the remote repository is called pushing changes

## Key Concepts: Branches
- All commits in git live on some branch
- But there can be many, many branches
- The main branch in a project is called the master branch

## So, what does a typical project look like?
- A bunch of commits linked together that live on some branch, contained in a repository
- Following images taken and modified from:
	- http://marklodato.github.io/visual-gitguide/index-en.html
	- Also a good tutorial!

## So, what is HEAD?
-  A reference to the most recent commit
